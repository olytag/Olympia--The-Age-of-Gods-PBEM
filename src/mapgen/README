	Olympia Map generator 1.0		Instructions for Use
	-------------------------		--------------------


1.  Construct an ascii character map of the world.  Each character
    represents one province.  Use the following characters to vary
    terrain:

	m or M		mountain
	d or D		desert
	p or P		plain
	f or F		forest
	; ~ " or :	sea lane
	s or S		swamp
	-		steppe
	. , \ or space	ocean
	o		random (30% forest/plain, 20% mountain, 10% swamp/desert)
	?		hidden province

	#		impassable region
				will be a "hole" in the map
	* or %		city

2.  Take care when placing ? provinces.  The terrain type will be
    inferred from one of the neighboring squares.

3.  Create a Regions file of the form:

	AA	Name of region AA
	AB	Name of region AB
	aa	Name of ocean aa
	zz	Name of ocean zz

    Do not use the letter 'o' in ocean/sea codes, since 'o' represents
    plains on the map.  I would have used another character besides 'o'
    for plains, but none looked as good visually.

4.  Name regions and oceans by placing the two letter code for them
    somewhere in the region.  Again, take care when placing the two
    letter codes, as the terrain type of the two squares taken up by
    the code will be inferred from neighboring provinces.

5.  Delineate seas by varying the character used to represent them.
    In this way, the first sea name will not flood-fill the entire
    ocean, since it will be stopped at the border.  For example:

		-------------------------
		~~~~~~........    ,,,,,,,
		~~~~~~~~...sa..    ,,,,,,
		~~~sb~~~~...... as ,,cs,,
		~~~~~~~~~......     ,,,,,
		-------------------------

	sa	Sea of Athens
	sb	Sea of Boetia
	as	Aedras Sea
	cs	Carthas Sea

    Spaces, ~'s ,'s and .'s may be used to represent seas.

6.  Run the map generator:

	mapgen < map 2> err

    The loc file is the Olympia database libdir/loc file.
    map should be your ascii character map.  The err file will contain
    useful information about land continents as well as any
    warnings issued during map generation.

7.  Although the Olympia map will wrap at the edges, for the purposes
    of flood-fill algorithms the map generator will stop at the edges.

8.  A * may be placed on land regions to indicate that a named city
    should go there.  Additional random cities will be scattered
    across the map.  City names will be read from the "Cities" file.
